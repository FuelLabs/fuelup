# Introduction

_fuelup_ is the official package manager for [Fuel] that installs The Fuel Toolchain
from the official release channels, enabling you to easily switch between different
toolchains and keep them updated. It makes building and maintaining Sway applications
simpler with [forc] and [fuel-core] for common platforms.

Check out the [Concepts] chapter for an overview of how _fuelup_ works and some
of the terminology it uses. The [Installation] chapter covers installing
fuelup and getting started.
