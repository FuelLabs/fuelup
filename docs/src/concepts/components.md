# Components

Each [toolchain] has several "components", which are tools used to develop on Fuel.

The `fuelup component` command is used to manage the installed components.

Components can be added to an already-installed toolchain with the `fuelup component` command:

```sh
fuelup component add forc
```

In custom toolchains, you also have the choice of adding a specific version of a component:

```sh
fuelup component add forc@0.30.1
```

## Components overview

The following is an overview of components installable through `fuelup`:

- [`forc`] — The Fuel Orchestrator, a suite of tools to work with the Fuel ecosystem. This comes
with some built-in plugin executables, including but not limited to: [`forc-client`], [`forc-fmt`] and [`forc-lsp`].
- [`fuel-core`] — Full node implementation of the Fuel v2 protocol, written in Rust.
- [`forc-explore`] — A Forc plugin for running the Fuel Block Explorer.
- [`forc-crypto`] — Forc plugin for hashing arbitrary data.
- [`forc-wallet`] - A Forc plugin for managing Fuel wallets.
- [`fuel-indexer`] - A standalone service that can be used to index various components of the Fuel blockchain.
- [`forc-index`] - A Forc plugin used to interact with a Fuel Indexer service.
