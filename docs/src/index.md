# Introduction

<!-- This section should explain what fuelup is -->
<!-- fuelup:example:start -->
_fuelup_ is the official package manager for [Fuel] that installs The Fuel Toolchain
from the official release channels, enabling you to easily switch between different
toolchains and keep them updated. It makes building and maintaining Sway applications
simpler with [forc] and [fuel-core] for common platforms.
