# Store

This is where all the actual binaries are installed and sometimes executed through
[overrides]. Components will be installed in directories named in the format `<NAME>-<VERSION>`.

For example, forc v0.35.5 will be installed in a directory called `forc-0.35.5`.

[overrides]: ../overrides.md
