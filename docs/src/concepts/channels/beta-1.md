# The `beta-1` channel

The `beta-1` channel is a published TOML file describing the toolchain that is compatible with our [beta-1 testnet](https://fuel-labs.ghost.io/introducing-beta-1-testnet/).
This toolchain should be used to interact with and build on the testnet. The components to be installed can be found [here](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuelup/blob/gh-pages/channel-fuel-beta-1.toml).
