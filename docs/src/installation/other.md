# Other installation methods

## Windows

We currently do not natively support Windows. If you wish to use `fuelup` on Windows, please
use [Windows Subsystem for Linux].

## Building from source

You can also install `fuelup` from source. Check out the git repository from
<https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuelup> and run `cargo run --release`.

You should then manually move the `fuelup` binary to `.fuelup/bin`.

## Direct download

`fuelup` binaries are released on our GitHub [releases page] where you can directly
download the appropriate bin for your system as well as check out our changelog.
